# Notes 09 (Stacks & Queues)

### Stacks & Queues

WHAT: Stacks and Queue are two data structures that are by nature destructive, and store data that will eventually be removed from the Data-Structure.

WHY: You would use this data structure in environments and applications where you need to sort through data and then remove it permanently. Applications like: A messaging Queue or ticket serving window.

HOW: A stack works by adding a node to the top of the stack where it can be viewed or "Popped" off the Stack.
This works similarly to a Queue where items are pushed to the back of the Queue and then items that are at the front of the Queue can be Dequeue'd.
