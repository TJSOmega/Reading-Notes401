# Notes 05 (Linked-Lists)

### Linked Lists
A Linked List is a non contiguous Data structure used to chain information that you may need to access sequentially. It is better than an array because of its non contiguous nature, but also must be traversed in one direction or the other unlike an array where you can go directly to a certain index. A Linked List is comprised of nodes and is always started by a Head node and ended by a Tail Node. The two types of Linked Lists are "Singly" (Can only be easily traversed in one direction), or "Doubly" (Easily traversible in either forward or reverse.)


### Big O Notation notes
Big O Notation: One way to think about Big O notation is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.

For example, if we have a list of the number 1–10, and we wanted to write an algorithm that multiplied each number by 10, we’d think about how much time that algorithm would take to multiply ten numbers. But what if instead of ten numbers, we had ten thousand? Or a million? Or tens of millions? That’s exactly what Big O Notation takes into account: the speed and efficiency with which something functions when its input grows to be any (crazy big!) size.
